## Client Server Architecture

> Client is lets say a end system which is requesting for a service from a server, example zomato mobile app requesting for a list of restaurants from zomato server. Server is a system which is providing a service to a client, example zomato server providing a list of restaurants to zomato mobile app. Now the server inorder to process the request may talk to a database and provide the response to the client. Now a database is a system which stores data and provides a service to the server. So the client is requesting for a service from the server, server is requesting for a service from the database and the database is providing a service to the server and the server is providing a service to the client.
